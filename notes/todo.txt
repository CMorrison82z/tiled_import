## TODO ##
- Write Bevy asset loader.
  - Load colliders
  - Handle `on_loaded`. See my sheep game `on_load_tmx` function for more details. Note that that implementation
    is also very rough and not well thought out.
  - Create a Scene object. It's an Asset thing containing entities. Reference : https://docs.rs/bevy_gltf/0.14.1/src/bevy_gltf/loader.rs.html#636
