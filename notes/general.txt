REFER TO JSON DOCS ! https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/json-map-format/

The `tmx` file is really supposed to be for the editor, not for ingesting into the game...
(Ex. `.blend` is a project file, but the model is the exported `glb`, etc.)

- Tile collision shapes are placed into an embedded layer `objectgroup`. It's not clear
  how this relates to other layers. It seems to ignore the Object ID increment
  scheme that takes place with objects in an `objectgroup` place on the map.
  Also, the ID of the embedded `objectgroup` itself is not clear what it relates to.

Cannot use a closure for making `get_parse` shorter and less repetitive because Rust closures can't
be generic ! :)
